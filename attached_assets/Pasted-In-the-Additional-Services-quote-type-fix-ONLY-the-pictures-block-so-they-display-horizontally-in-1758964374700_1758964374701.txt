In the “Additional Services” quote type, fix ONLY the pictures block so they display horizontally in one row, exactly like the working city quotes (Madrid/Vilnius). Do not change any other structure, text, or layout of this quote.

1) Find the template/component that renders the Additional Services images (e.g., AdditionalServicesQuote, QuoteAdditionalServices, template_additional_services.html). Replace ONLY the images markup with the SAME structure used by the working quotes:
   <!-- BEGIN: images block (keep the rest of the Additional Services template exactly as-is) -->
   <div class="image-strip image-strip--additional">
     <!-- render the 4 service photos here -->
     <!-- example static placeholders; keep your own image loop/data binding -->
     <img src="/public/img/additional1.jpg" alt="Additional service photo 1">
     <img src="/public/img/additional2.jpg" alt="Additional service photo 2">
     <img src="/public/img/additional3.jpg" alt="Additional service photo 3">
     <img src="/public/img/additional4.jpg" alt="Additional service photo 4">
   </div>
   <!-- END: images block -->

   Important: reuse the exact same HTML wrapper class used by the working quotes: .image-strip
   Only the image block changes; headings, lists, pricing, etc. must stay exactly the same.

2) In CSS (public/styles.css), append these scoped rules so the Additional Services images behave like the working quotes even if the parent container is narrow:
   /* --- Additional Services images: force single horizontal row --- */
   .image-strip {
     /* this class already exists in working quotes; leave as-is if already present */
   }

   /* Scope a safety override ONLY for Additional Services */
   .quote-section.destination-additional-services .image-strip,
   .additional-services .image-strip {
     width: 180mm !important;
     margin: 0 auto 8mm auto;
     display: flex !important;
     flex-wrap: nowrap !important;      /* prevent vertical stacking */
     gap: 4mm;
     align-items: stretch;
     break-inside: avoid;
     page-break-inside: avoid;
   }

   .quote-section.destination-additional-services .image-strip img,
   .additional-services .image-strip img {
     flex: 1 1 0;
     max-width: none;
     width: calc((180mm - 3 * 4mm) / 4); /* 4 images + 3 gaps */
     height: 45mm;                        /* adjust if you want them bigger */
     object-fit: cover;
     display: block;
   }

   @media print {
     .quote-section.destination-additional-services .image-strip,
     .additional-services .image-strip {
       width: 180mm !important;
     }
     .quote-section.destination-additional-services .image-strip img,
     .additional-services .image-strip img {
       width: calc((180mm - 3 * 4mm) / 4) !important;
     }
   }

3) Do NOT alter any other part of the Additional Services quote. Only swap the images block to use .image-strip (same as the working quotes), and apply the scoped CSS above. This must make the 4 photos appear in one horizontal row in the PDF, just like Madrid/Vilnius.
