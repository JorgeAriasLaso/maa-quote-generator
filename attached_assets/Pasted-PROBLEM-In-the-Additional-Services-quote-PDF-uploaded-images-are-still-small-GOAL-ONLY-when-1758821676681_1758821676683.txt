PROBLEM
In the "Additional Services" quote PDF, uploaded images are still small.

GOAL (ONLY when quote_type == "Additional Services")
- Use the ORIGINAL uploaded files (not preview thumbnails) in the PDF.
- Render each image nearly full content width (~18cm), one per line.
- No “Images” heading.
- Leave ALL other quote types unchanged.

IMPLEMENTATION

1) Use original files
- In the POST handler, pass server-saved file paths (e.g., /static/uploads/...) to the PDF template as `image_paths`.
- Do NOT use client-side preview data URLs or downsized thumbnails in the PDF.

2) Template markup (scoped)
- Ensure `is_additional_services = (quote_type == "Additional Services")` reaches the PDF template.
- For Additional Services branch only:
  <div class="pdf-images-as">
    {% for p in image_paths %}
      <img src="{{ p }}" class="pdf-image">
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
- Remove any “Images” heading in this branch.
- For all other types, keep the existing image block EXACTLY as is.

3) PDF CSS (scoped)
- In the PDF stylesheet (or a <style> used for PDF), add:
  .is-additional-services .pdf-images-as { width: 18cm; max-width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; }
  .is-additional-services .pdf-image {
    display: block;
    width: 18cm;
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    margin: 6mm 0;
    page-break-inside: avoid;
  }

4) Remove conflicting caps (scoped overrides)
- Under `.is-additional-services`, override any small-image rules:
  .is-additional-services img { max-width: none; }
  .is-additional-services .thumbnail,
  .is-additional-services .image-grid img { width: auto; max-width: 100%; }
- Delete/override grid/column classes that constrain width for this type.

5) Page size / margins
- Ensure wide content area:
  @page { size: A4; margin: 12mm; }

6) ***Parent container fix (very likely culprit)***
- For Additional Services ONLY, set the **parent wrapper** of the image block to:
  width: 18cm; max-width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;
- Remove any grid/column classes wrapping the images for this type (e.g., `row`, `col-3`, `w-1/4`, `grid grid-cols-4`, `flex flex-wrap`, `.image-grid { display:grid }`). Use a simple block container instead.

7) Keep other types intact
- Do NOT change image layout/CSS for other quote types.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKS
- With quote_type="Additional Services": each uploaded image appears on its own line and spans most of the content width (~18cm). No “Images” heading. No 4-up grid.
- With any other quote_type: image layout and labels exactly as before.
- Confirm the PDF uses original uploaded files (not preview thumbnails).

RETURN
- Short diff listing files changed (template + CSS + route), and where the parent-container fix was applied.
