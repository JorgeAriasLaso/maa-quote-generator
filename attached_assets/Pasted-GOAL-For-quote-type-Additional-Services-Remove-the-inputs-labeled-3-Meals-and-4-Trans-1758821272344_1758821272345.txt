GOAL
For quote_type == "Additional Services":
- Remove the inputs labeled “3. Meals” and “4. Transportation & Transfers” from the form UI.
- Do not require or process these fields server-side.
- Omit these sections entirely from the PDF output.
- For ALL other quote types, keep current behavior unchanged.

IMPLEMENTATION

1) Pass quote type to backend + template
- Ensure `quote_type` is read from the request and passed to the template.
- Compute boolean: `is_additional_services = (quote_type == "Additional Services")`.

2) Form UI (conditional render/hide)
- Wrap the current inputs for “3. Meals” and “4. Transportation & Transfers” in a conditional:
  - If using server-side templates (Jinja/EJS/Pug):
    Render those two inputs ONLY when `!is_additional_services`.
  - If client-side show/hide is easier, add a runtime check:
    When the quote type field == "Additional Services", hide the DOM blocks for those two inputs (display:none) and clear any values.

3) Validation + backend
- Update server-side validation so “Meals” and “Transportation & Transfers” are NOT required when `is_additional_services` is true.
- If values are posted anyway for this type, ignore them (do not save, do not use in totals).
- Ensure any calculations or summaries don’t assume these fields exist for this type.

4) PDF rendering
- In the PDF template, wrap “Meals” and “Transportation & Transfers” sections with:
  - Render them ONLY when `!is_additional_services`.
- For `is_additional_services`, do NOT show headings, rows, placeholders, or empty space for these sections.

5) Keep prior image/layout changes
- Preserve the existing scoped image changes for Additional Services (full-width, single column, no “Images” heading).
- Do not alter image behavior for other quote types.

6) Acceptance checks (show results)
- With quote_type = "Additional Services":
  - The form shows NO inputs labeled “3. Meals” and “4. Transportation & Transfers”.
  - Submitting works without those fields; no required-field errors.
  - The generated PDF contains NO sections/labels/rows for Meals or Transportation & Transfers.
- With another quote_type (e.g., “Standard Quote”):
  - The form still shows those two inputs as before.
  - The PDF still includes those sections as before.
- Provide a concise diff: which files changed and the conditional blocks added or validation updated.

DO NOT
- Do not remove these inputs globally.
- Do not rename or refactor unrelated fields.
- Do not add new dependencies.
