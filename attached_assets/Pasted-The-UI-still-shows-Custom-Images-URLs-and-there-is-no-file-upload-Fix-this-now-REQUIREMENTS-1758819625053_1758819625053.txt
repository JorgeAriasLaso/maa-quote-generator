The UI still shows “Custom Images (URLs)” and there is no file upload. Fix this now.

REQUIREMENTS (DO EXACTLY):
1) Replace the existing image URL input with a real file upload:
   - Label: “Upload image(s)”
   - <input type="file" id="images" name="images" accept="image/*" multiple>
   - Remove or hide the URL field entirely.
2) Ensure the form supports uploads:
   - <form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">  (add enctype)
3) Backend handling (match the current stack):
   - If Python/Flask: accept request.files.getlist("images"), save to /static/uploads, and pass those filepaths (or base64) to the PDF step.
   - If Node/Express: use multer (upload.array("images", 6)), serve /uploads as static, pass filepaths (or base64) to the PDF step.
   - Do not introduce a database or external hosts. Use local filesystem or base64 only.
4) PDF generation:
   - Insert the uploaded images into the PDF under an “Images” section, one per line, scaled to page width with margins and preserved aspect ratio.
   - If no images uploaded, omit the section entirely.
5) UI preview:
   - Show small previews of selected files before PDF generation (FileReader in browser).
6) Validation:
   - Allow JPG/PNG only, up to 5 MB each (max 6 images). Show a friendly error if invalid.

DO NOT:
- Do not keep any URL-based fields.
- Do not add accounts, databases, or external storage.
- Do not refactor unrelated code or add dependencies beyond what is strictly required for file upload.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKS (run and show results):
- The form contains an element: <input type="file" name="images" ...>.
- The main form tag includes enctype="multipart/form-data".
- I can select 1–3 images from my computer, see previews, and generate a PDF where those images appear under “Images”.
- With no images selected, the PDF has no “Images” section.

AFTER IMPLEMENTATION, SHOW:
- A very short list of files edited with the exact lines added/changed (diff or code blocks).
- A screenshot or GIF of the UI showing the “Upload image(s)” input (optional but preferred).
